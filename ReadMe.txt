# 🚀 Growth Mindset Challenge: ImageWrite AI

Welcome to **ImageWrite AI** — a project built as part of a **Growth Mindset Challenge** from our mentor. The challenge was to create something **different** from the tutorial provided, and this is my unique take on it.  

While the idea may not be entirely new, it’s my personal approach, reflecting how I applied what I learned in a different way. 💡
